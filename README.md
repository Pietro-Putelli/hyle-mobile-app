# Under the Hood

This React Native app is designed with a modular and scalable architecture, utilizing key libraries to manage authentication, state, performance, and device capabilities.

`@react-navigation/native & @react-navigation/native-stack`: For intuitive user flow and navigation, we leverage React Navigation. These libraries allow us to implement smooth and flexible navigation between screens, including deep linking and stack-based screen management.

`redux & @reduxjs/toolkit`: Redux is central to our state management, ensuring a unidirectional data flow across the app. Combined with Redux Toolkit, we implement efficient and scalable state logic, improving the app's maintainability and performance.

`@react-native-voice/voice`: This library powers the voice recognition capabilities of our app, allowing users to interact with the app via voice commands, providing an accessible and modern user interface.

`expo-file-system`: Expo File System is used for handling file access and storage on the device. This is especially useful for file downloads, uploads, and managing large media assets, ensuring optimal storage management.

`react-native-reanimated`: Reanimated is a powerful animation library used to create smooth, high-performance animations.

`react-native-mmkv`: MMKV provides fast and efficient storage for sensitive information, offering enhanced security for user data while maintaining high performance.

`react-native-vision-camera`: Vision Camera is a high-performance camera library that enables real-time image and video capture within the app. It supports advanced features like frame processing, enabling us to implement computer vision tasks and custom image recognition functionalities.
